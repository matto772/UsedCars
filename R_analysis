data and exploratoty analysis of regression of used car prices

I split the plot window into a 2x2 grid to display boxplots and histograms of the model_year and milage of vehicles to see the outliers and the distribution of data
model_year is skewed left and the milage is skewed right
a coorelation would make sense here between milage and model_year because there are more newer cars and more cars with fewer milage and there are less older cars and less cars with more milage


I summarized milage and model_year to see where the majority of data was


I stored outliers for milage and model_year columns so that I could remove them from the data set


I created a copy of the test data frame and removed the stored outliers from the copy of the data frame


I summarized milage and model_year from the new dataset created with outliers removed
the min for model_year changed but everything else stayed the same, indicating that the outliers were on the lower end of model_year
everything except for the min changed for the milage, indicating that the outliers were on the upper end of milage


I then created new plots of milage and model_year columns after the outlier removal in the copied data frame
the data became less dramtically skewed but still skewed in the same directions
there were still outliers in the milage column according to the boxplot, but they weren't outlier according to what math determines to be an outlier
