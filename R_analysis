data and exploratoty analysis of regression of used car prices
/*
I split the plot window into a 2x2 grid to display boxplots and histograms of the model_year and milage of vehicles to see the outliers and the distribution of data
model_year is skewed left and the milage is skewed right
a coorelation would make sense here between milage and model_year
there are more newer cars and more cars with fewer milage and there are less older cars and less cars with more milage
