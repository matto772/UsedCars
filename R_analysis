data and exploratoty analysis of regression of used car prices
/*
I split the plot window into a 2x2 grid to display boxplots and histograms of the model_year and milage of vehicles to see the outliers and the distribution of data
model_year is skewed left and the milage is skewed right
a coorelation would make sense here between milage and model_year
there are more newer cars and more cars with fewer milage and there are less older cars and less cars with more milage
*/



// summarizing milage and model_year to see where the majority of data lies



// storing outliers for milage and model_year columns to remove from data set


/* creating a copy of the test data frame
removing stored outliers from copy of data frame
*/



/*
summarizing milage and model_year from the new dataset created with outliers removed
the min for model_year changed but everything else stayed the same, indicating that the outliers were on the lower end of model_year
everything except for the min changed for the milage, indicating that the outliers were on the upper end of milage

//new plotting of milage and model_year columns after outlier removal in copied data frame
